		According to the United States Census, a region with a population density of fewer than two people per square mile is considered to be "unsettled" -- or, in a more common parlance, frontier. It was the 1890 census when no region on the map could be classified as "unsettled". In a country that defined itself against a rugged, wild continent aching for civilization, there was no more frontier to be found.
