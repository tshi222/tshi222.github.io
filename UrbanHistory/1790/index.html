		<p><font face="High Tower Text" size="4" color="#000000">In the year 1790, the nation was young. The Constitution had only been fully activated after the elections of 1788, in which George Washington was unanimously selected as the first President. The federal system was new, and the bitter political battles of the 1790s would attest to the nation's growing pains. Federalists and Democratic-Republicans would vie to establish the way the nation would grow. Most historians see this political division as existing along a North-South axis. This is quite true, but there are also signs of an urban-rural divide.</p>
		<p>Most of the nation lives on the small farm. The Jeffersonian ideal of the yeoman farmer would never be closer to a reality than in the early days of the republic. At the same time, however, there were clear trends toward urbanization. The map above shows the approximate location of all counties with urban populations of 2,500 or greater. Most of these plantations are quite small, but a few (New York City, Boston, Philadelphia) begin to approach the size of some of the smaller cities of Europe at the time.</p>
