		<p><font face="High Tower Text" size="4" color="#000000">In the year 1790, the nation was young. The Constitution had only been fully activated after the elections of 1788, in which George Washington was unanimously selected as the first President. The federal system was new, and the bitter political battles of the 1790s would attest to the nation's growing pains. Federalists and Democratic-Republicans would vie to establish the way the nation would grow. Most historians see this political division as existing along a North-South axis. This is quite true, but there are also signs of an urban-rural divide.</p>
		<p>Most of the nation lives on the small farm. The Jeffersonian ideal of the yeoman farmer would never be closer to a reality than in the early days of the republic. At the same time, however, there were clear trends toward urbanization. The map above shows the approximate location of all counties with urban populations of 2,500 or greater. Most of these plantations are quite small, but a few (New York City, Boston, Philadelphia) begin to approach the size of some of the smaller cities of Europe at the time.</p>
		<p>One can see a theme that will persist throughout American history: the northern states of the Union are home to a distinctly greater number of urban areas than the southern states.</p>

        	<p>In this series, "the North" or "Northeast" is defined by the northern boundary of Maryland -- a historical "border" state between the regions considered North and South by the public. In the above map you can note the high populations of New York and Massachusetts and their high number of urban areas. (NOTE: These symbols are not exactly representative of the location of urban areas; they are locked to the centroid of the county in which the urban areas reside.)</p>
        	<p>The Northeast in the 1790s was suited for urbanization. A high population growth rate coupled with a limited amount of land available and relatively poor soil and climate for very profitable crop production ensured that extremely large farms were uncommon. (The Hudson river valley is the exception to this rule -- great landlords feuded with tenants there for decades prior to and following the founding of the United States.) With the aforementioned conditions, the states of the North in 1790 saw both great migration to the unorganized territories in the west and movement into the coastal cities.</p>

        	<p>Boston, New York, and Philadelphia were the great metropolises of the 1790s. Boston, mapped as it existed in 1775, was both the oldest and least populous. It served then and now as the capital of Massachusetts and was the setting of much of the early drama leading up to the American Revolution. It was one of the most "European" of the great American cities -- settled on a highly defensible peninsula, home to a large common grazing area, and crossed by streets that follow the contours of the land, Boston took on many characteristics that belied its Old World origins.</p>
