		<p><font face="High Tower Text" size="4" color="#000000">In the year 1790, the nation was young. The Constitution had only been fully activated after the elections of 1788, in which George Washington was unanimously selected as the first President. The federal system was new, and the bitter political battles of the 1790s would attest to the nation's growing pains. Federalists and Democratic-Republicans would vie to establish the way the nation would grow. Most historians see this political division as existing along a North-South axis. This is quite true, but there are also signs of an urban-rural divide.</p>
		<p>Most of the nation lives on the small farm. The Jeffersonian ideal of the yeoman farmer would never be closer to a reality than in the early days of the republic. At the same time, however, there were clear trends toward urbanization. The map above shows the approximate location of all counties with urban populations of 2,500 or greater. Most of these plantations are quite small, but a few (New York City, Boston, Philadelphia) begin to approach the size of some of the smaller cities of Europe at the time.</p>
		<p>One can see a theme that will persist throughout American history: the northern states of the Union are home to a distinctly greater number of urban areas than the southern states.</p>

        	<p>In this series, "the North" or "Northeast" is defined by the northern boundary of Maryland -- a historical "border" state between the regions considered North and South by the public. In the above map you can note the high populations of New York and Massachusetts and their high number of urban areas. (NOTE: These symbols are not exactly representative of the location of urban areas; they are locked to the centroid of the county in which the urban areas reside.)</p>
        	<p>The Northeast in the 1790s was suited for urbanization. A high population growth rate coupled with a limited amount of land available and relatively poor soil and climate for very profitable crop production ensured that extremely large farms were uncommon. (The Hudson river valley is the exception to this rule -- great landlords feuded with tenants there for decades prior to and following the founding of the United States.) With the aforementioned conditions, the states of the North in 1790 saw both great migration to the unorganized territories in the west and movement into the coastal cities.</p>

        	<p>Boston, New York, and Philadelphia were the great metropolises of the 1790s. Boston, mapped above as it existed in 1775, was both the oldest and least populous. It served then and now as the capital of Massachusetts and was the setting of much of the early drama leading up to the American Revolution. It was one of the most "European" of the great American cities -- settled on a highly defensible peninsula, home to a large common grazing area, and crossed by streets that follow the contours of the land, Boston took on many characteristics that belied its Old World origins. Like the other coastal urban plantations, Boston was a center of shipping and trade for the United States. This in part was thanks to the large forests that then existed in New England and still feed industry in Maine.</p>

        	<p>New York City, mapped above as it existed in 1776, was founded second. Originally a Dutch trading settlement called New Amsterdam, the British took control in the late 17th century renamed the settlement. In 1790 the city served as the capital of the nation, hosting the president and Congress for a few months. Like Boston, New York city bears traces of its European origins. It was first established on the southern tip of Manhattan island with a Dutch fort, and the streets nearest the fort follow an irregular pattern along the contours of the land. The northernmost reaches of New York, however, had begun to show a distinctly American urban quality by 1790 -- the street grid. New York's famous regular grid of streets would be born in the 18th century and spread north along Manhattan island.</p>

        	<p>Philadelphia was the youngest and largest of these three cities. The city of brotherly love was another entrepot, taking in European goods at the port and shipping away American produce and crops. It would serve periodically as the capital of the nation between the 1770s and the 1790s. As is visible above, Philadelphia is the most distinctive for its gridded streets and central plaza set aside for a market. William Penn, the founder or Pennsylvania colony and Philadelphia, specifically designed the city with a commerical future in mind. He was influenced by the scientific thinking of the late-17th century which sought to regulate and understand the world systematically. Human activities such as economics and government were included in the study of the Enlightenment era, and the result was the city of Philadelphia. This model of gridded cities would become a common element to most American cities throughout the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries.</p>

        	<p>The South in 1790 is a different place. Hot, humid, brimming with rich soil, and drowning in land, the southern states are suited to cash crops and a rural landscape. Few regions in the South are densely populated, and the only "city" worthy of the title in 1790 was Charleston, South Carolina. Despite this, the most populous state in the Union in 1790 was Virginia -- the largest and oldest of the states, with its first permanent European settlers arriving in 1607. The South also stands out for its racial composition; the presence of thousands of African chattel slaves formed the basis for the tobacco, rice, indigo, and cotton producing industries. While the North had its own slaves -- most of which resided in New York -- these would be manumitted over the coming decades while the South's enslaved population would burgeon to a near majority of the population in some states.</p>

        	<p align="left">Above, one can see the difference in population densities for two typical states of the South and the North -- Virginia and New York, respectively. Note that population is concentrated in New York and dispersed in Virginia.</p>
        	
        	<p>With these divisions between north and south clear, and with the setting for urban America established, we can move on to the next decennial census. Link to 1800 to come.</p>
