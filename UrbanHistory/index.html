		<h2>Of Frontiers and Cities</h2>
		<p>According to the United States Census, a region with a population density of fewer than two people per square mile is considered to be "unsettled" -- or, in a more common parlance, frontier. It was the 1890 census when no region on the map could be classified as "unsettled". In a country that defined itself against a rugged, wild continent aching for civilization, there was no more frontier to be found.</p>
		
		<p>Undoubtedly, this imagination of the United States reliant upon the frontier is overly simplistic, and an argument can be made that it is in fact a destructive framework in which to discuss American history. One must understand that the growth of the United States came about thanks to the confluence of a million undercurrents, each flowing from disparate sources like individual initiative, economic upheaval, demographic transition, govenment policy, and the geography of the continent. Alternative frameworks that can account for many of these undercurrents would be better suited to the understanding of American history than the amorphous "frontier." One such framework may be found in the spread of American cities.</p>
		
		<p>The modern United States is an urban and suburban nation: many citizens live in cities, while many other live in the suburbs but work within the cities. This formulation did not exist in the founding decades of the nation. Eighteenth century America was a nation of farmers, living in low density across a fifty- to one hundred-mile swath of land hugging the Atlantic coast. The evolution in living space from this rural America of the late 1700s to the compact America of the 2010s parallels the development of the American city.</p>
		
		<p>American cities bear many marks of the history they have inhabited. The undercurrents of American history have shaped the morphology and geography of cities as the population moved and changed within the nations borders. Careful consideration of the patterns visible under the surface will give the viewer insight into the American past.</p>

		<p>With these in mind, here begins a series to look at the American city over time: where it is, how it looks, who lives within it, etc. Using data from the US Census, several maps of the country have been plotted with the locations of every urban area with a popualtion greater than 2500 for every ten years between 1790 and 1890 -- the closing of the frontier. These maps will guide the reader in understanding the evolution of the American city and the American nation.>
